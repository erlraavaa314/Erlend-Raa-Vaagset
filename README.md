# Erlend Raa VÃ¥gset: Research in Computational Topology, Parameterized Algorithms, and Teaching

This repository houses the source code for my academic website, accessible at [https://erlraavaa314.github.io/Educator-Researcher-Velociraptor/](https://erlraavaa314.github.io/Educator-Researcher-Velociraptor/). Explore my work in computational topology, parameterized algorithms, and my approach to teaching computer science.

## About Me
A brief overview of my background and research interests as an assistant professor at HVL.
I am an assistant professor at HVL. My research focuses on the applications of **computational topology** and **parameterized algorithms** to solve **NP-hard problems**. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring students.

## Research Areas
A summary of my work in computational topology and parameterized algorithms. Learn about topological data analysis and its applications.
My research centers on the application of tools from **topological data analysis (TDA)**, specifically **persistent homology**, to various problems in data analysis, robotics, and other fields. I also focus on the development of efficient **parameterized algorithms**, and aim to show that some are optimal using the exponential time hypothesis (ETH).

## Teaching
My philosophy on student-centered teaching, as well as details of courses I am teaching.
I believe in hands-on and inclusive teaching methods that foster curiosity and confidence in every student. I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my teaching practice and love experimenting with active learning.
See details of the courses I teach on the [teaching page](https://erlraavaa314.github.io/Educator-Researcher-Velociraptor/teaching.html).
