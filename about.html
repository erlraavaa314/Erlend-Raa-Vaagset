            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Erlend Raa Vågset, an Assistant Professor at HVL in Førde, Norway. My academic path started with mathematics, focusing on algebra and topology, before transitioning into computer science to work on algorithms, complexity theory, and machine learning. These days, I’m beginning to explore how robotics might connect to these fields by looking into configuration spaces and Lie theory.

            <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
            <h3>PhD Years</h3>
            <p>
                During my PhD at the University of Bergen, I focused on parameterized algorithms for NP-hard problems, blending ideas from fine-grained complexity and computational topology. My mentors, Nello Blaser and Mike Fellows, shaped how I tackle tough problems—with creativity and mathematical rigor.
            </p>

                <figcaption>They all say the same thing.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                A highlight of my PhD was collaborating with Mitchell Black and Amir Nayeri at Oregon State University, where we where lucky enough to discovered some really interesting results. 
            </p>
            <h3>Now at HVL</h3>
            <p>
                At HVL, I teach courses in algorithms and datastructures, introductory and advanced programming, and some machine learning as well. I’m also collaborating with colleagues on improving teaching through student-active learning. Recently, I’ve started looking into robotics by beginning to look into configuration spaces and Lie theory.
            </p>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                My teaching and outreach efforts are guided by a simple philosophy: learning thrives when curiosity is encouraged, and exploration is embraced as part of the process. I aim to create spaces where students feel they belong and can engage deeply with the material.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                I’ve contributed to outreach efforts like <em>Forskerdagene</em> and <em>Opplev Marineholmen</em>. I also helped with the effort to translate some of the <em>Bebras Computational Thinking Challenges</em> into Norwegian, helping make computer science more accessible and engaging for everyone.

            <h2>On a Personal Note</h2>
            <p>
                When I’m not working, you might find me kayaking in the fjords, experimenting with home-brewed beer (with mixed results), or picking up a hobby I’ll abandon next week. Living in Western Norway offers the perfect blend of calm reflection and adventure.
