                    I'm Erlend Raa Vågset, an Associate Professor in Computer Science at HVL in Førde.
                    I work on computational complexity and topology and enjoy trying to apply mathematical ideas to concrete problems, especially in the fields of robotics, machine learning and, perhaps suprisingly, also in data analysis.

                    NP-hard problems are among the hardest challenges in computer science, appearing everywhere from planning the fastest pizza deliveries to organizing wedding seating charts. These problems are so complex that finding efficient solutions is often impossible, but parameterized algorithms offer a way forward by focusing on the most critical aspects. This approach shifts the focus from solving local pieces to understanding the problem as a whole.

                    So far, my work has focused on topology, the study of shapes and spaces, which provides powerful tools for analyzing global structures in data. Topology helps uncover persistent patterns—features that remain consistent even when data is simplified. This has practical applications in understanding sensor coverage, clustering high-dimensional data, and mapping the configuration space of complex systems. I’ve also begun exploring robotics as a way to connect my research with practical applications, investigating how abstract structures and motion planning can be combined with topology to solve real-world challenges.                </p>

                   I believe in hands-on, student-centered and inclusive learning that helps my students to grow, not only in their technical capabilities but also in their curiosity and creativity. I want my courses to be all about building a supportive learning environment where everyone are included and everyone gets to contribute actively in class.

                    As a mentor and advisor, I enjoy helping my students work on exciting, real-world projects, often in collaboration with local industry here in Førde. My approach to supervision is best described as 'support for independence'—offering guidance while encouraging students to take ownership of their work. I'm constantly amazed by what they achieve, and I’m proud to say I often learn more from them than they do from me.                 </p>

                <p>
                     I started my studies with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, followed by a Master's degree in (algebraic) topology, where I wrote a thesis on log Hochschild homology, supervised by Christian Schlichtkrull. This background introduced me to many of the technical and conceptual frameworks that inform my work today.
                </p>
                <p>
                   During my PhD at the University of Bergen, I wrote my thesis on parameterized algorithms for NP-hard problems in topology, under the supervision of Nello Blaser and Michael Fellows. A highlight of my PhD, was my stay at Oregon State University, where I worked with Mitchell Black and Amir Nayyeri.

                    When I’m not working, I love trying out new hobbies—some stick, and some don’t. Over the years, I’ve spent time kayaking, hiking, cross-country skiing, weightlifting, and playing board games—I even dabbled in home-brewing. Staying active and finding ways to break up the routine keeps life interesting.
