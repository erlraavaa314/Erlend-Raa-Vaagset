        <h2>Mentoring and Supervision</h2>
        <p>
            I see mentoring as a partnership grounded in trust, dialogue, and care. Rather than relying on strict frameworks, I work closely with students through open conversations that help them develop a deeper understanding of their own thinking, writing, and projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to guide students toward independence — not by removing obstacles, but by helping them navigate challenges with clarity and confidence. I strive to create a space where it feels safe to take risks, sit with complexity, and grow through difficulty. I'm present, attentive, and on their side, without rushing to fix or rescue.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe that good mentorship involves knowing when to step in and when to step back. My role is to support, not to shield — to be a steady presence that students can rely on, especially when things get hard, while still leaving room for them to find their own way forward.
        </p>

        <p>
            I take mentoring seriously because I know both how powerful good mentorship can be — and how painful it is when that support is missing. Earlier in my academic journey, I had a difficult experience with an advisor who failed to offer the care and respect I now see as essential.<sup>1</sup> That awareness has shaped a mentoring approach rooted in presence, patience, and genuine collaboration.
        </p>
        
        <p class="footnote">
        <sup>1</sup> This refers to an early advising experience and does <strong>not</strong> include any of the mentors I’ve named elsewhere in these pages. On the contrary, they are all brilliant, generous advisors, and I continually strive to emulate their example in my own work.
