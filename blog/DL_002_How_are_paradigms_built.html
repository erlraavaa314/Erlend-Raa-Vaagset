          <h1>Not Just a Theory: Building the Lens</h1>
    
          <p>This isn’t just theory to me.</p>
    
          <p>I’ve listened to stories told by my PhD advisor, <strong>Mike Fellows</strong>, describing how <em>parameterized complexity theory</em> came to be—how he and <strong>Rod Downey</strong> built it from the ground up. What stayed with me wasn’t just the theory—it was the intentionality.</p>
    
          <blockquote>
            Mike once confided in me that, at the time, he was <strong>consciously thinking about what a paradigm needs in order to be useful</strong>—not just elegant or interesting, but <em>usable</em> for real research.
          </blockquote>
    
          <p>That changed how I understood research itself.</p>
    
          <p>They weren’t just solving puzzles or publishing results. They were reshaping the terrain:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Proposing new meanings for <em>solvable</em> and <em>hard</em></li>
            <li>Arguing that NP-hard problems weren’t all equally hard</li>
            <li>Reframing difficulty not by size alone, but by the <strong>structure</strong> hidden inside that size</li>
          </ul>
    
          <blockquote>
            What makes a problem hard, he explained, isn’t just its scale—it’s the chaos that scale allows.
          </blockquote>
    
          <p>To make that insight stick, they had to invent new terms. New standards. New questions. A new community of researchers who could speak the language and extend the frame.</p>
    
          <p>That’s paradigm work.</p>
    
          <p>And if we want to build a meaningful, democratic approach to education, we’ll need the same kind of scaffolding. Not just isolated practices or good intentions—but a framework people can build on.</p>
    
         
    
<h2>The Craft of a Paradigm: A Working Map</h2>

<p>This post steps back—not to slow down, but to show how new fields, new worldviews, and new models of education are actually built.</p>

<p>Paradigms don’t appear fully formed. They’re made—deliberately, socially, and often messily. They begin as insights, but become structures: shared assumptions, guiding values, and tools that let people work together toward something real.</p>

<p>What follows isn’t a checklist. It’s a kind of lens—a working map of the invisible labor that gives a paradigm its shape and strength.</p>

<p>It begins with <strong>word-making</strong>. Every paradigm needs its own language. New terms, new distinctions—these aren’t just labels, they’re tools that let us see differently. Without them, the paradigm can’t take hold.</p>

<p>From there comes <strong>question-casting</strong>: deciding what kinds of questions are worth asking, and which ones no longer belong. Paradigms don’t just answer questions—they declare what’s worth wondering about.</p>

<p>To work, a paradigm also needs <strong>rule-setting</strong>—a sense of what counts as valid inquiry. What counts as rigorous? What’s an acceptable method? These norms don’t come from nowhere—they’re crafted and negotiated over time.</p>

<p>And once you’re asking questions, you need to know what counts as an answer. That’s <strong>result-shaping</strong>. Paradigms set expectations for success: what progress looks like, what a breakthrough means, what counts as insight at all.</p>

<p>But they don’t include everything. Every paradigm involves <strong>line-drawing</strong>—not just what it includes, but what it leaves out. What’s central, and what’s peripheral? Who belongs in the conversation, and who doesn’t?</p>

<p>None of this matters unless people take part. That’s where <strong>commons-building</strong> comes in. A paradigm needs community—shared spaces, shared values, shared curiosity. Without this, even the best ideas fade.</p>

<p>Underneath all of it is <strong>value-weaving</strong>. Paradigms carry ethics and aesthetics, often quietly. They shape what’s seen as elegant, just, beautiful, meaningful—even when we don’t talk about it.</p>

<p>They also carry a sense of time. <strong>Time-tilting</strong> is how paradigms relate to the past and the future: are we breaking from tradition? Reclaiming something lost? Inventing what’s next?</p>

<p>And as they grow, paradigms need to take care of themselves. That’s <strong>frame-keeping</strong>: staying coherent, absorbing critique, refining their own terms without losing direction.</p>

<p>Finally, some paradigms catch on not just because they’re smart, but because they <strong>resonate</strong>. <strong>World-tuning</strong> is what happens when a paradigm lines up with broader cultural shifts—when it speaks to the moment, even before the moment knows what it’s asking for.</p>
<p>This isn’t a final theory. It’s just a sketch—a paradigm for thinking about paradigms. And it’s here to be questioned, revised, extended.</p>

<p>Because if we want to reimagine education—not just in theory, but in practice—we need more than good ideas. </p>
