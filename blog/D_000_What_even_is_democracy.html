      <h2>Which Democracy?</h2>
      <p><em>“When a word stops connecting to practice, it starts meaning everything — or nothing.”</em></p>

      <p><em>“I believe in democracy.”</em><br>
      It sounds clear — until someone asks:<br>
      <em>“Which one?”</em></p>

      <p>We grow up hearing the word. It’s in textbooks, speeches, protest signs, job descriptions. We’re told to believe in it. Defend it. Be proud of it.</p>

      <p>But ask what democracy actually <em>feels like</em> in everyday life, and the answers get blurry.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Is it voting?</li>
        <li>Having rights?</li>
        <li>Being heard?</li>
        <li>Having a say in decisions that matter?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We say “democracy,” but we’re not all talking about the same thing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>It’s a bit like saying “I believe in God.”</em><br>
        Everyone nods — until someone asks:<br>
        <em>“Which one?”</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Or maybe it’s more like saying:<br>
      <em>“I like apples.”</em></p>

      <p>Do you mean crisp and green? Soft and sweet? Baked into pie? Pressed into cider?</p>

      <p>We think we’re saying something clear — until someone asks for detail. And then we realize: we’re not naming a single thing. We’re naming a whole <strong>range</strong> of meanings.</p>

      <p>Democracy is like that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When use disappears, meaning fades</h2>
      <p>Wittgenstein once said:<br>
      <em>“Don’t ask for the meaning, ask for the use.”</em></p>

      <p>Words don’t live in dictionaries. They live in how we use them — in what they let us do, and how they show up in practice.</p>

      <p>If “democracy” once meant <strong>shared authorship</strong>, <strong>collective responsibility</strong>, and <strong>the right to shape what shapes you</strong>, then its meaning relied on people actually doing those things.</p>

      <p>Now? We use the word for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A vote, every few years</li>
        <li>A survey with no follow-up</li>
        <li>A classroom where rules are explained, not made</li>
        <li>A workplace that listens, but doesn’t respond</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The word is still here. But the practice has gone quiet.</p>

      <h2>When students grow up inside shallow versions of democracy</h2>
      <p>They’re taught democratic ideals — but rarely invited to experience them.</p>

      <p>They might vote for a class representative,<br>
      but they don’t help design the rules that govern them.</p>

      <p>They might be asked for their opinion,<br>
      but not included in the decisions that follow.</p>

      <p>They learn the word.<br>
      But not the practice.</p>

      <p>And so the word becomes thinner. Familiar, but vague.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>And yet, we keep using it</h2>
      <p>In George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, language is controlled by force. The state doesn’t just dictate action — it rewrites meaning.</p>

      <p>Words are bent into their opposites:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>War is peace</li>
        <li>Freedom is slavery</li>
        <li>Ignorance is strength</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It’s deliberate. Terrifying. Heavy-handed.</p>

      <p>But things didn’t go that way with democracy.</p>

      <p>There was no Ministry of Truth.<br>
      No one redefined it overnight.</p>

      <p>Instead, the word wore down slowly — through habit, repetition, and a quiet drifting away from lived experience.</p>

      <p>Now we say:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Democracy is voting every few years.”</li>
        <li>“Democracy is saying your opinion and being thanked.”</li>
        <li>“Democracy is watching someone else decide.”</li>
        <li>“Democracy is giving feedback that changes nothing.”</li>
        <li>“Democracy is bureaucracy.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And eventually —</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Democracy becomes the word we use for something we no longer expect to shape.</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>It still sounds good.<br>
      It just doesn’t point to much anymore.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>So what do we do?</h2>
      <p>We start by noticing.</p>

      <p>By asking what democracy really means — not in theory, but in <strong>practice</strong>.</p>

      <p>By looking closely at the distance between <em>the word</em> and <em>the experience</em>.</p>

      <p>Because even if the details differ — like with God, or apples — most of us still sense what democracy is supposed to mean.</p>

      <p>And when that meaning is left unused, others are always ready to reshape it — sometimes subtly, sometimes not.</p>

      <p>In the next post, we’ll explore the different ways people interpret democracy — and why even the most well-meaning version starts to fail when participation fades, feedback disappears, and people are no longer part of shaping their shared lives.</p>
