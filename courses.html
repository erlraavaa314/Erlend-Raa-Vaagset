            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring 2025: DAT102 - Algorithms and Data Structures</strong><br>An introduction to efficient problem-solving and critical computational thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring 2025: DAT191 – Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Science</strong><br>
                    Final-year students work in small groups to design, build, and document a substantial software or research project—often involving real users, external partners, or experimental ideas. I supervise about 4 projects each year, offering feedback, guidance, and a steady presence along the way.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fall 2024: DAT108 - Programming and Web Applications</strong><br>From frontend to backend, explore the art of full-stack development.</li>        
                <li> <strong>Fall 2024: DAT111 – Introduction to Software Development</strong><br>
                    A multidisciplinary introduction to programming, web development, and software engineering methods. I teach the Python programming component of the course.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fall 2024: DAT158 - Machine Learning and Advanced Algorithms</strong><br>Hands-on learning with generative AI, model training, and cutting-edge algorithms. I host the labs in Førde.</li>
