          <h2>Democratic Learning</h2>
      
          <p>
            This project came out of the blue — and also out of everything.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Over the past few years, through teaching, reflection, and some genuinely transformative pedagogy courses at HVL, I’ve found myself circling the same set of questions: What does it mean to learn in a way that’s free, communal, and creative? What kind of education helps people grow not just as thinkers, but as participants in shared life? And why do so many “active” learning models still feel… passive?
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I’m now working — with my partner <strong>Noa Ben David</strong> — to articulate a new educational paradigm. One that builds on the best of student-active teaching, but moves beyond it. One where activity isn’t the end goal — but where <strong>freedom</strong>, <strong>community</strong>, and <strong>authorship</strong> are at the center.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Noa brings a deep well of lived experience to this: she went through a fully democratic school system as a student — the real kind, where students help govern the institution — and she’s now a doctoral researcher at UCL, working at the intersection of political theory and education. We approach this work from different angles, but we share a belief that students can be trusted with more than they’re usually given — and that learning becomes transformative when it’s something we build together.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            This isn’t just a topic. It feels like the thread that’s been running through my teaching all along — now coming into view. I've started writing a series of posts to map out where this might go:
          </p>
      
          <ul>
            <li><a href="blog/DL_000_Why_democratic_learning.html">Why We Need Democratic Learning</a></li>
            <li><a href="blog/DL_001_What_are_paradigms.html">What Is a Paradigm? (Or: The Lens We Don’t See)</a></li>
            <li><a href="blog/DL_002_How_are_paradigms_built.html">Not Just a Theory: Building the Lens</a></li>
            <li><a href="blog/DL_003_A_sketch_of_a_democratic_education.html">A Sketch of a Democratic Education</a></li>
            <li><a href="blog/DL_004_The_Preparadigmatic_Landscape.html">Mapping the Pre-Paradigm</a></li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>
            There’s more coming — posts, conversations, maybe even practice. But this is the beginning of something that feels real. And worth pursuing.
