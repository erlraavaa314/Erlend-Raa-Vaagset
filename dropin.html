            <h2>Drop-In</h2>
            <p>
                Every Thursday from <strong>14:30 to 17:00</strong>, the <strong>Læringslabben</strong> at HVL Førde is open for drop-in help with <strong>math, computer science, and physics</strong>. Students from HVL and nearby high schools are all welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bring your homework, open questions, or just something you’ve been stuck on. Whether you're working on foundational exercises or more advanced topics, you're invited to sit down, ask questions, and learn with others in a relaxed setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The drop-in is organized together with <strong>Gizem</strong>, <strong>Camilla</strong>, and myself at Læringslabben. We’re here every week — no sign-up, no pressure. Just show up, grab a seat (and maybe a waffle), and join in.
