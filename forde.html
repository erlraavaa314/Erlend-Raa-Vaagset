            <h2>HVL Campus Førde</h2>
    
            <p>
                I teach informatics at HVL's Førde campus — a small, tight-knit place where it's easy to know your students, and just as easy to accidentally run into your boss in the lunch queue. We’ve got programs in nursing, automation, electrical engineering, and computer science. But these days, a lot of the buzz is about robotics.
            </p>

            <p>
                We’re building up a great little robotics community here, with student projects, lab work, and applied research all happening side by side. One of my favourite things about teaching here is how much freedom students have to explore their own ideas — whether it’s prototyping a robot, simulating control systems, or just debugging something that's been driving them nuts all week.

            <p>
                Førde isn’t exactly a metropolis — but it’s a great place to work. You’ve got fjords on one side, forests on the other, and Jølster just up the road. That’s where the painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Astrup" target="_blank">Nikolai Astrup</a> lived and worked, and his paintings kind of sum up the place: dramatic skies, heavy greens, and that weird mix of stillness and intensity that only really makes sense if you’ve been here.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether I’m teaching algorithms or debugging Python with a student at 4pm on a Friday, this is a good place to be. The coffee is strong, the students are clever, and the mountains aren’t going anywhere.
