            <h2>Outreach</h2>
            <p>
                I am the founder and organizer of our local <strong>Kattis programming competitions</strong>, hosted in a social-learning format at the <strong>Læringslabben</strong> at HVL. The event runs alongside <strong>math drop-in sessions</strong> — with plenty of <strong>fresh waffles</strong> to go around.
            </p>
            <p>
                These sessions are open to HVL students and local high schoolers, and are run in collaboration with Gizem and Camilla. We aim to make problem-solving and programming engaging, approachable, and fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also volunteer at <strong>community tech events</strong> like the Global Game Jam, and I'm working on launching a <strong>SciSnack</strong> group at HVL Førde — a space for students and researchers to explore science writing, communication, and informal reflection together.
