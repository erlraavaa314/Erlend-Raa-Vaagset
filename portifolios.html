                This project is part of an ongoing experiment in democratic education. Each page represents a student not through grades or self-description alone, but through how their peers have seen them—how they contributed, what they made possible, and what it was like to learn alongside them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content is authored collaboratively. Students are invited to reflect on one another’s work and presence, and to write short, concrete descriptions of what stood out—intellectually, interpersonally, or otherwise. The tone is honest, respectful, and specific.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are not performance reviews or lists of achievements. They are written accounts of recognition—grounded in shared work, shared time, and shared learning.
