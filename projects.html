            <h2>Academic Projects</h2>
            <p>
                My current focus is on broadening the scope of my research and teaching — especially in the areas of <strong>democratic education</strong> and <strong>robotics</strong>. I'm particularly interested in how educational environments can be more participatory, student-driven, and responsive, both in theory and in practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the robotics side, I’m beginning to explore <strong>path planning</strong> problems for agricultural robots — including raspberry-picking systems. It’s an early-stage inquiry, but an exciting intersection of algorithms and real-world complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also supervise a range of student projects, particularly in <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>. These include work on large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), image recognition, time series analysis, and more. Through this, I’m constantly learning — both from the technologies and from the students shaping them. For examples of recent work, see the <a href="mentoring.html">mentoring</a> page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside new directions, I'm also revisiting and wrapping up several long-running collaborations and unpublished results. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ongoing work on <strong>persistent homology computations</strong> with Nello</li>
                <li>Research on <strong>embeddings of simplicial complexes</strong> with Mitchel and Amir</li>
                <li>Joint work on <strong>discrete Morse theory</strong> with Geevarghese Philip</li>
                <li>Member of a <strong>pedagogical research group</strong> at HVL with Bjarte and Marcin, focused on in-class video use and related themes</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Teaching & Outreach -->
        <section>
            <h2>Teaching & Outreach Initiatives</h2>
            <p>
                I co-organize our local <strong>Kattis programming competitions</strong>, which we run in a social-learning format at the <strong>Læringslabben</strong> (our student learning lab at HVL). The event runs alongside <strong>math drop-in sessions</strong> — and yes, there are always <strong>fresh waffles</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sessions are open to HVL students and local high schoolers, and are co-hosted with Gizem and Camilla. Our goal is to make algorithmic problem-solving accessible, informal, and community-driven — part competition, part curiosity, part comfort food.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also volunteer at community tech events like the <strong>Global Game Jam</strong>, and I'm working on launching a local branch of <strong>SciSnack</strong> — a writing and discussion group for students and researchers interested in science communication, reflection, and informal knowledge sharing. The initiative is part of an international network of the same name.
