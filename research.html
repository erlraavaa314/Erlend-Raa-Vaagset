            <h2>Exploring the Shape of Data with Topology</h2>
            <p>
                Topology is the study of shapes, spaces, and their connections. Unlike geometry, which focuses on precise measurements, topology emphasizes properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, like stretching or bending. It helps us ask fundamental questions: What does this space look like? How is it connected?
            </p>
            <p>
                A classic example of this principle is the famous <strong>mug-to-torus transformation</strong>. 
                In topology, a coffee mug with a handle is often considered equivalent to a doughnut (torus) because one can be smoothly deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. 
                But what if we take things even further?
            </p>
    
            <figure>

                <figcaption>
                    This unusual coffee mug starts with a <strong>doughnut-like hole in the center</strong> instead of a flat base. 
                    As it morphs, its structure changes until it becomes a <strong>genus-three surface</strong>—a shape with three distinct loops. 
                    This transformation highlights how topology classifies shapes based on their connectivity rather than their rigid form.

            </figure>
    
            <p>
                In data analysis, topology offers a similar perspective. Rather than examining individual data points, 
                it focuses on <strong>global structures</strong>—clusters, loops, and gaps—that reveal the relationships within the data. 
                These tools are particularly valuable in noisy, high-dimensional datasets where traditional methods often fail.

    <h2>What is Topological Data Analysis (TDA)?</h2>
    <p>
        Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applies the principles of topology to real-world data, turning abstract mathematical ideas into actionable insights. 
        One of its key techniques is <strong>persistent homology</strong>, which studies how structures in data—like clusters, loops, or voids—appear and disappear as we adjust our perspective.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        An excellent introduction to persistent homology, featuring many beautiful animations, is given in 
        <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/persistent-homology-with-examples-1974d4b9c3d0" target="_blank">Gary Koplik's blog post</a>. 
        The animation below demonstrates how the <strong>topological summary of a dataset evolves</strong> as points move.
    </p>
    
    <figure>
        <img src="images/perstop.gif" alt="Visualization of 1D persistent homology as loops form in a dataset">
        <figcaption>
            Initially, the points are scattered randomly, but they gradually reorganize into three distinct circles. 
            As the dataset changes, the persistence diagram tracks topological features: three prominent points appear far above the diagonal, 
            corresponding to the three 1-dimensional loops. The animation illustrates how persistent homology captures these evolving structures.
            The animation is from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/persistent-homology-with-examples-1974d4b9c3d0" target="_blank">Gary Koplik's article</a>.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Imagine slowly raising the water level over a mountain range. Peaks emerge, merge, and eventually vanish underwater. 
        Persistent homology captures which peaks last the longest, highlighting the features that are most meaningful. 
        Tools like persistence diagrams summarize this information, separating noise from structure and enabling us to uncover patterns invisible to traditional approaches.
    </p>

        <figcaption>
            A related idea is <strong>Morse theory</strong>, which studies how topological features appear and disappear as we vary a function. 
            This animation by <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Mathijs.Wintraecken/Mathematica.html" target="_blank">Mathijs Wintraecken</a> 
            illustrates how level sets evolve, similar to how persistent homology tracks topological changes in data.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        A striking example of TDA in action comes from the work of <strong>May-Britt and Edvard Moser</strong>, 
        who received the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2014/summary/" target="_blank">2014 Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> for their discovery of grid cells—neurons that help animals navigate space. 
        More recently, their research revealed that <strong>grid cell activity is structured on a toroidal manifold</strong>, demonstrating how TDA can uncover hidden geometric patterns in complex neural data.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/moser.png" alt="Persistent homology of grid cells, showing a toroidal topology in neural activity">
        <figcaption>
            This visualization from the Moser group shows what Topological Data Analysis (TDA) looks like in practice. 
            The structure revealed in neural activity forms a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) topology, identified using persistent homology.

    <h2>Complexity Theory: Understanding Computational Limits</h2>
    <p>
        If you've ever struggled with an impossibly hard problem, you might have gone through something like this:
    </p>
    
    <!-- Comic Panel 1 -->
    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/cartoon1.png" alt="Stage 1: Self-doubt" style="width:80%; height:auto; margin:20px auto;">
    </figure>
    
    <p>
        First, self-doubt. You try every algorithm you can think of, but nothing works.  
        Maybe the problem is just difficult. Maybe you are just not clever enough to solve it.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Comic Panel 2 -->
    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/cartoon2.png" alt="Stage 2: Realization" style="width:80%; height:auto; margin:20px auto;">
    </figure>
    
    <p>
        Then, the realization: maybe it’s not just you—maybe no one can solve it efficiently.  
        But proving this is surprisingly hard. In fact, determining whether a problem can truly be solved efficiently  
        is the biggest open problem in computer science.  
        <a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium/p-vs-np/" target="_blank">Solving it is literally a million-dollar question.</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So where does that leave us? We can’t solve it. We can’t even prove that we can’t solve it.  
        We’re stuck.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But if no one else has solved it either, maybe we’re onto something.  
        If we can’t find a solution, proving that it’s hard is the next best thing.  
    </p>
    
    <!-- Comic Panel 3 (NOW in the right place) -->
    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/cartoon3.png" alt="Stage 3: Theoretical triumph" style="width:80%; height:auto; margin:20px auto;">
    </figure>
    
    <p>
        This is where NP-completeness comes in. We can’t prove a problem is hard directly,  
        so we take a different approach: we link it to other problems we already believe are hard.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Think of it like a row of dominoes. Instead of proving that one specific domino is impossible to push over,  
        we show that if you could push this one over, the entire row would fall.  
    </p>
    
    <!-- Comic Panel 3 (NOW in the right place) -->
    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/dominos.gif" alt="Infinite dominoes" style="width:80%; height:auto; margin:20px auto;">
    </figure>

    <p>
        Since no one has ever managed to knock down the last domino,  
        we take that as strong evidence that the first one won’t fall either.  
        In complexity theory, this is called a reduction: if solving one problem would also solve all the others,  
        we assume the first problem is at least as hard as the rest.
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        Many problems I work on are <strong>NP-hard</strong>, meaning that solving them outright for large inputs is likely infeasible.  
        Complexity theory offers tools to analyze these problems and find ways forward. For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Some problems allow for approximate solutions, where we trade precision for feasibility.</li>
        <li>Others become easier when we focus on specific features, reducing the computational burden.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Parameterized Complexity Section -->
<section>
    <h2>Parameterized Complexity: A Fine-Grained Perspective</h2>
    <p>
        Parameterized complexity recognizes that not all parts of a problem are equally hard.  
        Instead of treating everything as one big challenge, we focus on the core difficulty.  
    </p>

    <!-- Palm Kernel Image -->
    <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/palmkernel.jpg" alt="Palm fruit kernel" 
        title="Finding the hard core of a problem and stripping away the easy parts." 
        style="width:100%; height:auto; margin:20px auto;">
        <figcaption>Finding the hard core of a problem and stripping away the easy parts.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Many problems have an easy outer layer and a hard inner core.  
        If we can strip away the easy part quickly, the remaining problem becomes much smaller and faster to solve.  
    </p>

    <p>
        I use this idea to study problems in topology, such as homology localization,  
        where isolating key structures makes computation more efficient.
    </p>
</section>


        <!-- Intersection Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Bringing Complexity Theory and Parameterized Complexity Together</h2>
            <p>
                Complexity theory provides the "big picture" of computational difficulty, while parameterized complexity offers the tools to navigate it. Together, they create a framework for tackling NP-hard problems by identifying the most manageable aspects of a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complexity theory tells us why computing geometric representatives for persistent homology for large datasets is hard.</li>
                <li>Parameterized complexity helps us design algorithms that focus on key features, like the number of dimensions or specific regions of interest, to make these computations feasible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My research lies at the intersection of these fields, using parameterized algorithms to tackle problems in computational topology. By analyzing the computational cost of topological tools and designing efficient algorithms, I aim to uncover new ways of navigating the boundaries of computation.
