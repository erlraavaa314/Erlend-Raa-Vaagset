        <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <p>
            Since coming to Førde, I’ve found myself thinking more and more about robotics. The environment here — the people, the labs, the way robotics quietly weaves through the place — has started to shape the kinds of questions I’m asking.
        </p>
        <p>
            My background is in topology and complexity theory, but it turns out many core robotics problems live right at that intersection. Questions about motion, reachability, safety — these are often questions about the structure of space. And when those spaces are high-dimensional, with constraints and obstacles, topology becomes more than relevant — it becomes necessary.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Configuration Spaces</h2>
        <p>
            A configuration space is the set of all ways a robot can exist — its positions, orientations, joint angles, etc. For simple systems, these might be smooth and compact. But in most real-world scenarios, they’re fragmented, strange, full of holes. They’re topological spaces in disguise.
        </p>
        <p>
            My previous work focused on understanding spaces like this from a computational point of view: how to model them, reason about their structure, and identify what makes them hard. That lens carries over naturally into robotics — especially when we care not just about existence, but about what’s possible, what’s efficient, and what’s fundamentally out of reach.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Path Planning</h2>
        <p>
            In robotics, <strong>path planning</strong> usually means finding a safe, efficient route from one state to another. But once you look at this in the configuration space sense, it becomes something else entirely. It’s no longer about a robot navigating a room — it’s about navigating a high-dimensional space, where each point represents a full-body pose or system state, and where collisions and constraints carve out complex holes and barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that perspective, planning a path means finding a continuous trajectory through a strange and often fragmented space. Are two configurations connected? What does a bottleneck look like? Are there distinct homotopy classes of solutions? These are topological questions, and they map directly onto things I've worked on: connectivity, complexity, and structure in hard spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hope is that by applying insights from computational topology and parameterized complexity, we can get better at understanding not just whether a path exists, but why — and what makes one problem easy and another impossibly hard.
        </p>
