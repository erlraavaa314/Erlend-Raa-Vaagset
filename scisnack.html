            <h2>SciSnack in Førde</h2>
            <p>
                SciSnack is a global network of researcher-led writing and discussion groups focused on science communication. It provides an informal, low-pressure environment for researchers and students to practice communicating their work — and to reflect on science more broadly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently working on launching a local SciSnack group at HVL Førde. The goal is to create a space for students and researchers to write, talk, and think together.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're at HVL and interested in joining — or just curious — feel free to get in touch!
