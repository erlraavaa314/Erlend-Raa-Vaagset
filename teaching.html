            <h2>My Approach to Teaching</h2>
            <p>
                I strive to cultivate a democratic, student-centered learning environment—one that values agency, collaboration, and community. While institutional constraints limit how far students can shape learning goals or grading criteria, I actively involve them in co-governing the classroom and shaping the learning process within those boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                My role is not to dictate knowledge, but to facilitate a shared journey of inquiry. I encourage students to explore their interests, take responsibility for their learning, and support each other. This includes communal problem-solving sessions, student-led initiatives, and co-creating parts of the course experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside the classroom, I work to strengthen the academic community by organizing programming competitions and supporting peer-led events, such as the Global Game Jam events held at Førde (hosted by Erlend S. and Gizem). These collective efforts help students connect learning with purpose, creativity, and real-world practice.
