            <h2>My Approach to Teaching</h2>
            <p>
                As an Assistant Professor at HVL, I aim to create a learning environment where students feel empowered to explore, collaborate, and grow. I believe in making learning hands-on, student-centered, and inclusive—fostering curiosity and confidence in every student.

        <!-- Mentoring Philosophy -->
        <section>
            <h2>Mentoring and Supervision</h2>
            <p>
                I see mentoring as a partnership. My role is to support and guide students as they tackle projects that inspire them—encouraging independence, creativity, and resilience along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it’s exploring machine learning applications or diving into theoretical computer science, I’m always excited to collaborate and help students bring their ideas to life.

        <!-- Outreach -->
        <section>
            <h2>Outreach and Community</h2>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about making computer science accessible to all. From school visits to coding workshops, I love creating opportunities for hands-on learning—whether it’s introducing children to sorting networks or exploring computational thinking with adults.
