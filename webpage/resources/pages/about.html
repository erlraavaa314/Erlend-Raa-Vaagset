                        <p>
                            I‚Äôm Erlend Raa V√•gset, soon to defend my PhD at the University of Bergen (UiB), where I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with Nello Blaser and Michael Ralph Fellows. My research spans algorithms, machine learning, and computational topology ‚Äì all driven by a deep curiosity for the unexplored and the complex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I‚Äôm an Assistant Professor at HVL F√∏rde, teaching Computer Science and Informatics. My academic interests include complexity theory, algorithms, and topology, where I enjoy exploring theoretical puzzles and expanding our understanding of these fascinating fields.

                        <p>
                            I'm an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), specifically at the F√∏rde campus‚Äîa tiny city tucked deep within the stunning fjords. I‚Äôve just submitted my PhD in algorithms and machine learning at the University of Bergen (UiB).

                        <p>
                            My PhD research focused on the computationally challenging problem of finding optimal geometric representations of global topological features in data. Sounds complicated, right? Well, it is. But it‚Äôs also incredibly exciting!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            More broadly, I‚Äôm interested in complexity theory, computational topology, and exploring how abstract concepts in these fields can lead to new insights and discoveries. If you're curious to know more, feel free to check out my <a href="research.html">research interests</a> page.

                            Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not just a nerd! Over the years, I‚Äôve gathered a broad collection of hobbies in what can only be described as a heroic attempt to appear more interesting than I really am.

                        <p>
                            My adventurous side includes climbing, swimming, hiking, kayaking, skiing, weightlifting, and windsurfing (though not all at the same time!). But when I‚Äôm not outdoors, you can catch me playing board games, listening to music, or experimenting with homebrewing.
