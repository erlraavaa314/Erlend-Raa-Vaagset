                    Drawing on more than a decade of teaching experience, I aim to cultivate a love for ideas, learning and exploration among my students.
                    My goal is to build a learning environment that is open, inclusive and student centric. 
                    Concretely, I do my best to make my courses as student active as possible through the frequent use of exercises, collaborative learning and peer evaluation.
                    It is my belief that this approach leads to more critical thinking, increased creativity and a strong classroom community.
