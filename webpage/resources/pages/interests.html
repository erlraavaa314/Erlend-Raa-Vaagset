                        <p>
                            My interest in computational topology stems from its ability to find patterns in data that might otherwise be hidden. Using tools like persistent homology, I work on analyzing the shape of data across scales, which has applications in neuroscience, materials science, and more. For instance, in neuroscience, topology helps us understand how different regions of the brain interact.

                        <p>
                            In complexity theory, I focus on parameterized algorithms. These algorithms let us zero in on the variables that matter most, turning large, tough problems into something we can solve more efficiently. It’s a practical approach that applies to fields like bioinformatics, where analyzing vast genetic datasets is critical, or in robotics, where real-time decision-making is key.

                            I also work with topological data analysis (TDA) in unsupervised machine learning. TDA is great at finding structure in messy, high-dimensional data, which makes it useful in areas like single-cell genomics and climate science. It helps us find patterns where traditional methods might struggle.

                            While my primary focus is on complexity theory and topology, I’ve had the opportunity to explore machine learning through projects with my students. Together, we’ve worked on real-world challenges like image recognition for sewage treatment, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and chatbots for the construction industry.
                        </p>
                        <p> These projects have been a two-way street. My students bring fresh ideas about AI, while I guide them through algorithmic thinking. It’s been exciting to see how machine learning and traditional methods can come together to solve problems in ways I hadn’t anticipated.

                            I’ve also been experimenting with large language models (LLM) to assist with writing and organizing ideas. This website, for instance, was shaped with the help of AI tools. While my focus remains on research and teaching, I’m always curious about how AI can support creativity and communication.

                        <p>
                            I’m passionate about teaching, and I’ve been exploring how to make learning more engaging and flexible. Recently, I’ve focused on video-based learning. Videos allow students to engage with difficult concepts at their own pace, which has been especially effective in my flipped classroom model. Students watch lectures on their own time, and we use class time for discussion and problem-solving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m also researching effective teaching methods to help students take control of their learning. My goal is to create a dynamic learning environment that encourages curiosity and active participation.
